Institute for AI\u2020, Facebook AI Research\u00b6\nhttp://pjreddie.com/yolo/\nAbstract\nWe present YOLO, a new approach to object detection.\nPrior work on object detection repurposes classi\ufb01ers to per-\nform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a re-\ngression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and\nassociated class probabilities. A single neural network pre-\ndicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from\nfull images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection\npipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end\ndirectly on detection performance.\nOur uni\ufb01ed architecture is extremely fast. Our base\nYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames\nper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,\nprocesses an astounding 155 frames per second while\nstill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-\ntors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO\nmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predict\nfalse positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very\ngeneral representations of objects. It outperforms other de-\ntection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener-\nalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.\n1. Introduction\nHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-\njects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter-\nact. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow-\ning us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con-\nscious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec-\ntion would allow computers to drive cars without special-\nized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time\nscene information to human users, and unlock the potential\nfor general purpose, responsive robotic systems.\nCurrent detection systems repurpose classi\ufb01ers to per-\nform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a\nclassi\ufb01er for that object and evaluate it at various locations\nand scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts\nmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the\nclassi\ufb01er is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire\nimage [10].\nMore recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal\n1.

Unlike sliding window and region\nproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image\nduring training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex-\ntual information about classes as well as their appearance.\nFast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back-\nground patches in an image for objects because it can\u2019t see\nthe larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number\nof background errors compared to Fast R-CNN.\nThird, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-\njects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-\nwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM\nand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-\neralizable it is less likely to break down when applied to\nnew domains or unexpected inputs.\nYOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems\nin accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im-\nages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe-\ncially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our\nexperiments.\nAll of our training and testing code is open source. A\nvariety of pretrained models are also available to download.\n2. Uni\ufb01ed Detection\nWe unify the separate components of object detection\ninto a single neural network. Our network uses features\nfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also\npredicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im-\nage simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob-\nally about the full image and all the objects in the image.\nThe YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-\ntime speeds while maintaining high average precision.\nOur system divides the input image into an S\u00d7Sgrid.\nIf the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell\nis responsible for detecting that object.\nEach grid cell predicts Bbounding boxes and con\ufb01dence\nscores for those boxes. These con\ufb01dence scores re\ufb02ect how\ncon\ufb01dent the model is that the box contains an object and\nalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-\nmally we de\ufb01ne con\ufb01dence as Pr(Object )\u2217IOUtruth\npred. If no\nobject exists in that cell, the con\ufb01dence scores should be\nzero. Otherwise we want the con\ufb01dence score to equal the\nintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box\nand the ground truth.\nEach bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x,y,w,h,\nand con\ufb01dence. The (x,y)coordinates represent the center\nof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width\nand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finally\nthe con\ufb01dence prediction represents the IOU between the\npredicted box and any ground truth box.\nEach grid cell also predicts Cconditional class proba-\nbilities, Pr(Classi|Object ). These probabilities are condi-\ntioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predictone set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the\nnumber of boxes B.\nAt test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-\nties and the individual box con\ufb01dence predictions,\nPr(Classi|Object )\u2217Pr(Object )\u2217IOUtruth\npred= Pr( Classi)\u2217IOUtruth\npred(1)\nwhich gives us class-speci\ufb01c con\ufb01dence scores for each\nbox. These scores encode both the probability of that class\nappearing in the box and how well the predicted box \ufb01ts the\nobject.\nS \u00d7 S grid on inputBounding boxes + confidence\nClass probability mapFinal detections\nFigure 2: The Model. Our system models detection as a regres-\nsion problem.

Training\nWe pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet\n1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use\nthe \ufb01rst 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a\naverage-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train\nthis network for approximately a week and achieve a single\ncrop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida-\ntion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe\u2019s\nModel Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all\ntraining and inference [26].\nWe then convert the model to perform detection. Ren et\nal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-\ners to pretrained networks can improve performance [29].\nFollowing their example, we add four convolutional lay-\ners and two fully connected layers with randomly initialized\nweights. Detection often requires \ufb01ne-grained visual infor-\nmation so we increase the input resolution of the network\nfrom 224\u00d7224to448\u00d7448.\nOur \ufb01nal layer predicts both class probabilities and\nbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding box\nwidth and height by the image width and height so that they\nfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box x\nandycoordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-\ntion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1.\nWe use a linear activation function for the \ufb01nal layer and\nall other layers use the following leaky recti\ufb01ed linear acti-\nvation:\n\u03c6(x) ={\nx, ifx>0\n0.1x,otherwise(2)\nWe optimize for sum-squared error in the output of ourmodel.

When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007\ntest data for training. Throughout training we use a batch\nsize of 64, a momentum of 0.9and a decay of 0.0005 .\nOur learning rate schedule is as follows: For the \ufb01rst\nepochs we slowly raise the learning rate from 10\u22123to10\u22122.\nIf we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges\ndue to unstable gradients.

A dropout layer with rate = .5 after the \ufb01rst\nconnected layer prevents co-adaptation between layers [18].\nFor data augmentation we introduce random scaling and\ntranslations of up to 20% of the original image size. We\nalso randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im-\nage by up to a factor of 1.5in the HSV color space.\n2.3. Inference\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image\nonly requires one network evaluation. On P ASCAL VOC the\nnetwork predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class\nprobabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test\ntime since it only requires a single network evaluation, un-\nlike classi\ufb01er-based methods.\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound-\ning box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an\nobject falls in to and the network only predicts one box for\neach object. However, some large objects or objects nearthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi-\nple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to \ufb01x these\nmultiple detections. While not critical to performance as it\nis for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2-\n3% in mAP.\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding\nbox predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes\nand can only have one class.

We\nalso randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im-\nage by up to a factor of 1.5in the HSV color space.\n2.3. Inference\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image\nonly requires one network evaluation. On P ASCAL VOC the\nnetwork predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class\nprobabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test\ntime since it only requires a single network evaluation, un-\nlike classi\ufb01er-based methods.\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound-\ning box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an\nobject falls in to and the network only predicts one box for\neach object. However, some large objects or objects nearthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi-\nple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to \ufb01x these\nmultiple detections. While not critical to performance as it\nis for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2-\n3% in mAP.\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding\nbox predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes\nand can only have one class. This spatial constraint lim-\nits the number of nearby objects that our model can pre-\ndict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in\ngroups, such as \ufb02ocks of birds.\nSince our model learns to predict bounding boxes from\ndata, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual\naspect ratios or con\ufb01gurations.

A small error in a large box is generally benign but a\nsmall error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU.\nOur main source of error is incorrect localizations.\n3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems\nObject detection is a core problem in computer vision.\nDetection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of\nrobust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23],\nHOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classi\ufb01ers\n[36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify\nobjects in the feature space. These classi\ufb01ers or localizers\nare run either in sliding window fashion over the whole im-\nage or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39].\nWe compare the YOLO detection system to several top de-\ntection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differ-\nences.\nDeformable parts models. Deformable parts models\n(DPM) use a sliding window approach to object detection\n[10]. DPM uses a disjoint pipeline to extract static features,\nclassify regions, predict bounding boxes for high scoring\nregions, etc. Our system replaces all of these disparate parts\nwith a single convolutional neural network. The network\nperforms feature extraction, bounding box prediction, non-\nmaximal suppression, and contextual reasoning all concur-\nrently. Instead of static features, the network trains the fea-\ntures in-line and optimizes them for the detection task. Our\nuni\ufb01ed architecture leads to a faster, more accurate model\nthan DPM.\nR-CNN. R-CNN and its variants use region proposals in-\nstead of sliding windows to \ufb01nd objects in images.

Each stage of this\ncomplex pipeline must be precisely tuned independently\nand the resulting system is very slow, taking more than 40\nseconds per image at test time [14].\nYOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid\ncell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those\nboxes using convolutional features. However, our system\nputs spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which\nhelps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our\nsystem also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98\nper image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search.\nFinally, our system combines these individual components\ninto a single, jointly optimized model.\nOther Fast Detectors Fast and Faster R-CNN focus on\nspeeding up the R-CNN framework by sharing computa-\ntion and using neural networks to propose regions instead\nof Selective Search [14] [28]. While they offer speed and\naccuracy improvements over R-CNN, both still fall short of\nreal-time performance.\nMany research efforts focus on speeding up the DPM\npipeline [31] [38] [5]. They speed up HOG computation,\nuse cascades, and push computation to GPUs. However,\nonly 30Hz DPM [31] actually runs in real-time.\nInstead of trying to optimize individual components of\na large detection pipeline, YOLO throws out the pipeline\nentirely and is fast by design.\nDetectors for single classes like faces or people can be\nhighly optimized since they have to deal with much less\nvariation [37].

MultiBox can also\nperform single object detection by replacing the con\ufb01dence\nprediction with a single class prediction.

With 52.7%mAP, it is more than twice as accurate\nas prior work on real-time detection. YOLO pushes mAP to\n63.4%while still maintaining real-time performance.\nWe also train YOLO using VGG-16.

It is use-\nful for comparison to other detection systems that rely on\nVGG-16 but since it is slower than real-time the rest of the\npaper focuses on our faster models.\nFastest DPM effectively speeds up DPM without sacri-\n\ufb01cing much mAP but it still misses real-time performance\nby a factor of 2 [38].

By using YOLO to eliminate background detec-\ntions from Fast R-CNN we get a signi\ufb01cant boost in perfor-\nmance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we\ncheck to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we\ngive that prediction a boost based on the probability pre-\ndicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes.\nThe best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8%\non the VOC 2007 test set.

Generalizability: Person Detection in Artwork\nAcademic datasets for object detection draw the training\nand testing data from the same distribution. In real-world\napplications it is hard to predict all possible use cases andthe test data can diverge from what the system has seen be-\nfore [3]. We compare YOLO to other detection systems on\nthe Picasso Dataset [12] and the People-Art Dataset [3], two\ndatasets for testing person detection on artwork.\nFigure 5 shows comparative performance between\nYOLO and other detection methods. For reference, we give\nVOC 2007 detection AP on person where all models are\ntrained only on VOC 2007 data. On Picasso models are\ntrained on VOC 2012 while on People-Art they are trained\non VOC 2010.\nR-CNN has high AP on VOC 2007. However, R-CNN\ndrops off considerably when applied to artwork. R-CNN\nuses Selective Search for bounding box proposals which is\ntuned for natural images. The classi\ufb01er step in R-CNN only\nsees small regions and needs good proposals.\nDPM maintains its AP well when applied to artwork.\nPrior work theorizes that DPM performs well because it has\nstrong spatial models of the shape and layout of objects.\nThough DPM doesn\u2019t degrade as much as R-CNN, it starts\nfrom a lower AP.\nYOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP\ndegrades less than other methods when applied to artwork.\nLike DPM, YOLO models the size and shape of objects,\nas well as relationships between objects and where objects\ncommonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very\ndifferent on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of\nthe size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict\ngood bounding boxes and detections.\n5. Real-Time Detection In The Wild\nYOLO is a fast, accurate object detector, making it ideal\nfor computer vision applications.

Our model is simple to construct and can be traineddirectly on full images. Unlike classi\ufb01er-based approaches,\nYOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds\nto detection performance and the entire model is trained\njointly.\nFast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detec-\ntor in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in\nreal-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to\nnew domains making it ideal for applications that rely on\nfast, robust object detection.\nAcknowledgements: This work is partially supported by\nONR N00014-13-1-0720, NSF IIS-1338054, and The Allen\nDistinguished Investigator Award.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1737, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2ec7a2f-2224-40d1-832c-1f877f81dda1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2ec7a2f-2224-40d1-832c-1f877f81dda1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1506.02640v5.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/1506.02640v5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5296750, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "218d7d16-263c-4034-ae2a-c790bb47c1c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1506.02640v5.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/1506.02640v5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5296750, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "1c28a568f893e1c148a16f953e9e188eb69e5f5167c665dcf7a42c986cdeec3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce897bc5-3f39-4a5c-8362-136c23b92e35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "729e7b9b04c1719ebdbbf1fc8729ad43a0b9a55b57c0820c46715a019625702e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "References\n[1] M.

One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited \nfor coining the term, \u00aamachine learning\u00ba with his research (link resides outside ibm.com) \naround the game of checkers.

These insights \nsubsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally \nimpacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market \ndemand for new data scientists will increase.

Machine learning, deep learning, and neural \nnetworks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually \na sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks. \nThe way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm \nlearns. \"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised \nlearning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn't necessarily require a labeled dataset. The \ndeep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), \nand it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different \ncategories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention \nrequired and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning \nas \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides \noutside ibm.com). \nClassical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to \nlearn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences \nbetween data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn. \nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, \ncontaining an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or \nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the \noutput of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is \nactivated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed \nalong to the next layer of the network by that node. The \u00aadeep\u00ba in deep learning is just \nreferring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of \nmore than three layers\u00d0which would be inclusive of the input and the output\u00d0can be \nconsidered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network.

Based on some input data, which can be labeled or \nunlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data. \nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If \nthere are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess \nthe accuracy of the model. \nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the \ntraining set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the \nknown example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative \n\u00aaevaluate and optimize\u00ba process, updating weights autonomously until a \nthreshold of accuracy has been met. \nMachine learning methods \nMachine learning models fall into three primary categories. \nSupervised machine learning \nSupervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use \nof labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. \nAs input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted \nappropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the \nmodel avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a \nvariety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder \nfrom your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, \nna\u00efve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector \nmachine (SVM). \nUnsupervised machine learning \nUnsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine \nlearning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters). \nThese algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for \nhuman intervention. This method\u2019s ability to discover similarities and differences in \ninformation make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, \ncustomer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It\u2019s also used to reduce the \nnumber of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal \ncomponent analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common \napproaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural \nnetworks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods. \nSemi-supervised learning \nSemi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and \nunsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide \nclassification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised \nlearning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised \nlearning algorithm. It also helps if it\u2019s too costly to label enough data. \nFor a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out \"Supervised \nvs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference?\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3759, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3795c79c-5678-4417-b022-da8fe34d8a5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3795c79c-5678-4417-b022-da8fe34d8a5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ML.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/ML.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38172, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e55320d-decd-4ded-8075-c2f51d81d4ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ML.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/ML.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38172, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "789aa1893228435f2514c2fe69cb3e64655f0dec6a182e5700bfbe23b9edfe19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Reinforcement machine learning \nReinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to \nsupervised learning, but the algorithm isn\u2019t trained using sample data. This model learns \nas it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced \nto develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem. \nThe IBM Watson\u00ae system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example. \nThe system used reinforcement learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or \nquestion, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to \nwager\u2014especially on daily doubles. \nLearn more about reinforcement learning \nCommon machine learning algorithms \nA number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include: \nNeural networks: Neural networks simulate the way the human brain works, with \na huge number of linked processing nodes. Neural networks are good at \nrecognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural \nlanguage translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation. \nLinear regression: This algorithm is used to predict numerical values, based on a \nlinear relationship between different values. For example, the technique could be \nused to predict house prices based on historical data for the area. \nLogistic regression: This supervised learning algorithm makes predictions for \ncategorical response variables, such as \u201cyes/no\u201d answers to questions. It can be \nused for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a \nproduction line. \nClustering: Using unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify \npatterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by \nidentifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked. \nDecision trees: Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values \n(regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching \nsequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of \nthe advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit, \nunlike the black box of the neural network. \nRandom forests: In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a \nvalue or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees. \nAdvantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms \nDepending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm \ntype\u2014supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement\u2014has its own \nadvantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both \npredicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories. \nDecision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented \nwith a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to \nvalidate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more \nunstable than other decision predictors. \nOverall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage \nfor new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in \nmassive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires \nlittle human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning \nsystem assemble and refine its own algorithms\u2014which will continually improve with \nmore data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized \nexperience as the model learns more with every experience with that person. \nOn the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate \nand unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering \nsufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on \nresources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With \ntoo small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is \ncompletely wrong or misleading.

Many mobile devices \nincorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search\u2014e.g. Siri\u2014or \nimprove accessibility for texting. \nCustomer service: Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer \njourney, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and \nsocial media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about \ntopics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or \nsuggesting sizes for users. Examples include virtual agents on e-commerce sites; \nmessaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by \nvirtual assistants and voice assistants. \nComputer vision: This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful \ninformation from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the \nappropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has \napplications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and \nself-driving cars in the automotive industry. \nRecommendation engines: Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can \nhelp to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling \nstrategies.

Supervised learning can train a model using information about \nknown fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look \natypical and deserve further investigation. \nChallenges of machine learning \nAs machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. \nHowever, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of \nethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include: \nTechnological singularity \nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned \nwith the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological \nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick \nBostrum defines superintelligence as \u201cany intellect that vastly outperforms the best \nhuman brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, \nand social skills.\u201d Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the \nidea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous \nsystems, like self-driving cars. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never \nhave an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should \nwe still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to \nsemi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, \nbut these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI \ntechnology develops. \nAI impact on jobs \nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this \nconcern should probably be reframed.

For example, when we look at the \nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric \nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn\u2019t going away, \nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one. \nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas.

The biggest challenge with \nartificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition \nto new roles that are in demand. \nPrivacy \nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data \nsecurity. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent \nyears. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data \nof people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more \ncontrol of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such \nas the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and \nrequires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation \nsuch as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally \nidentifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an \nincreasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and \nopportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks. \nBias and discrimination \nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have \nraised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we \nsafeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be \ngenerated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good \nintentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights \nsome of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their \neffort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against \njob candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap \nthe project. Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com) has raised other \npointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should \nbe able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role. \nBias and discrimination aren\u2019t limited to the human resources function either; they can \nbe found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media \nalgorithms. \nAs businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they\u2019ve also become more \nactive in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its \ngeneral purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna \nwrote: \u201cIBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial \nrecognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, \nviolations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent \nwith our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.\u201d \nAccountability \nSince there isn\u2019t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real \nenforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for \ncompanies to be ethical are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system on the \nbottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration \nbetween ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI \nmodels within society.

One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited\nfor coining the term, \u201cmachine learning\u201d with his research (link resides outside ibm.com)\naround the game of checkers. Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master,\nplayed the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he lost to the computer.\nCompared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial, but it\u2019s considered a major\nmilestone in the field of artificial intelligence.\nOver the last couple of decades, the technological advances in storage and processing\npower have enabled some innovative products based on machine learning, such as\nNetflix\u2019s recommendation engine and self-driving cars.\nMachine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science.\nThrough the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or\npredictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights\nsubsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally\nimpacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market\ndemand for new data scientists will increase. They will be required to help identify the\nmost relevant business questions and the data to answer them.\nMachine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks such as Python that\naccelerate solution development by using platforms like TensorFlow or PyTorch.\nNow available: watsonx.ai\nThe all-new enterprise studio that brings together traditional machine learning along\nwith new generative AI capabilities powered by foundation models.\nTry watsonx.ai\nBegin your journey to AI\nLearn how to scale AI\nExplore the AI Academy\nMachine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks\nSince deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it\u2019s worth\nnoting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural\nnetworks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually\na sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.\nThe way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm\nlearns. \"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised\nlearning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The\ndeep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images),\nand it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different\ncategories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention\nrequired and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning\nas \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides\noutside ibm.com).\nClassical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to\nlearn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences\nbetween data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers,\ncontaining an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or\nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the\noutput of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is\nactivated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed\nalong to the next layer of the network by that node. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning is just\nreferring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of\nmore than three layers\u2014which would be inclusive of the input and the output\u2014can be\nconsidered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that\nonly has three layers is just a basic neural network.\nDeep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas\nsuch as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\nSee the blog post \u201cAI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks:\nWhat\u2019s the Difference?\u201d for a closer look at how the different concepts relate.\nRelated content\nExplore the watsonx.ai interactive demo\nDownload \u201cMachine learning for Dummies\u201d\n- This link downloads a pdf\nExplore Gen AI for developers\nHow does machine learning work?\nUC Berkeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a\nmachine learning algorithm into three main parts.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8400c65-b3a1-48dc-8131-2cfa5ec78c65": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8400c65-b3a1-48dc-8131-2cfa5ec78c65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2024-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d188e238-954e-41bc-b5dd-a1cc692ee3e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2024-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "2d81ca4fa101861a1672ca6daab5ed37fe335148aa00c93908d84adf381be8da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "abb0e676-41d5-4fcf-bc85-64f562253a1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2024-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "6b17d5868287452c8502b186020e5710e885a737af21b4871205b8cd57f5f92a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bfd537d3-97f3-4f1f-9459-174bc228e231", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb1c8cf0f23caea26faadce7f993ffb9ada03f9d8ab6868ab7d5ba9d6517c1c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised\nlearning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a labeled dataset.

One of\nthe advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit,\nunlike the black box of the neural network.\nRandom forests: In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a\nvalue or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms\nDepending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm\ntype\u2014supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement\u2014has its own\nadvantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both\npredicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories.\nDecision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented\nwith a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to\nvalidate and audit than a neural network.

When reviewing multiple\nvendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features =\na better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI\nplatform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to\nbe delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature\nmight doom the usefulness of an entire system.

The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signi\ufb01cantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature.\n1 Introduction\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 12] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\nin particular, have been \ufb01rmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 29,2,5]. Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [31, 21, 13].\n\u2217Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the \ufb01rst Transformer models and\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work.

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstatesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsigni\ufb01cant improvements in computational ef\ufb01ciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional\ncomputation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,16]. In all but a few cases [ 22], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for signi\ufb01cantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[20], ByteNet [ 15] and ConvS2S [ 8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more dif\ufb01cult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the \ufb01rst transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1,...,y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\n\u221adk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1\u221adk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer.

This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[31, 2, 8].\n\u2022The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n\u2022Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation \ufb02ow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u2212\u221e) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff= 2048 .\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by\u221admodel.\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3174, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d8a90c8-2947-4398-8b29-f1fcdc7179a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d8a90c8-2947-4398-8b29-f1fcdc7179a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "96cae9dc-6bcd-426d-b017-437b0759dbdc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "035388793dcb29f8f034a41beb68c714c0cb72fdc47e3dd6fdd5ac8c1ab53e98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2\u00b7d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n\u00b7d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k\u00b7n\u00b7d2)O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r\u00b7n\u00b7d)O(1) O(n/r)\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.

We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1,...,x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), withxi,zi\u2208Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\n6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3508, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c672c9d-4fbf-44f5-af5a-7730bcc9cf1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c672c9d-4fbf-44f5-af5a-7730bcc9cf1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8a572b8-1c98-4aa6-9ce7-3f9d146c8687", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "f2631000182eb3ba675a475fec97fe0720b040103528fe2bd092693143c2c82b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k\u00b7n\u00b7d+n\u00b7d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side bene\ufb01t, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signi\ufb01cantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] with\u03b21= 0.9,\u03b22= 0.98and\u03f5= 10\u22129. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate =d\u22120.5\nmodel\u00b7min(step_num\u22120.5,step _num\u00b7warmup _steps\u22121.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the \ufb01rst warmup _steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\nPdrop= 0.1.\n7", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3209, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78aa90ce-17ac-441d-bc0b-3959b580c624": {"__data__": {"id_": "78aa90ce-17ac-441d-bc0b-3959b580c624", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "548b5fd5-1f1b-45bc-82a1-5e23e9b50fe3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "d0c5687a47407b54c0bf92444e141eb0f762c67300cad343c015549f5cc585c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [15] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [32] 39.2 1.0\u00b71020\nGNMT + RL [31] 24.6 39.92 2.3\u00b710191.4\u00b71020\nConvS2S [8] 25.16 40.46 9.6\u00b710181.5\u00b71020\nMoE [26] 26.03 40.56 2.0\u00b710191.2\u00b71020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [32] 40.4 8.0\u00b71020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [31] 26.30 41.16 1.8\u00b710201.1\u00b71021\nConvS2S Ensemble [8] 26.36 41.29 7.7\u00b710191.2\u00b71021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3\u00b71018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.0 2.3\u00b71019\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value \u03f5ls= 0.1[30].

The con\ufb01guration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty \u03b1= 0.6[31]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of \ufb02oating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\nsingle-precision \ufb02oating-point capacity of each GPU5.\n6.2 Model Variations\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\n8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3283, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1c13aa7-2097-4817-b001-147e871335e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1c13aa7-2097-4817-b001-147e871335e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "627848df-3f76-4afc-8a39-bf1dccdb3132", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "2e7f581b32deadbf80156a4fa41337808c666b068c0352f9ec922d226531e14c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to ef\ufb01ciently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\n9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2609, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f500f20-6260-43d3-adb5-a322abcf4fcb": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f500f20-6260-43d3-adb5-a322abcf4fcb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f955d464-e5d5-4159-b86a-803243b25eac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pavankumar/Projects/Llama-index-Agent/Data/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 569417, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-07"}, "hash": "3ef67d5c478ff670bac04f3ead6abf0bfeb8d00d7317ce53d10c5f5a27e9c7ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb0113cf-d9ee-44c4-99d4-40a594695607", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "732bc7aae7819af31fc44576f8c06d9a8eb5683ee441ce648099af9d24e2cfbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "References\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
